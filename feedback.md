# Feedback

I'm always interested at getting better and providing value. Your feedback is very appreciated.

If you feel so inclined, please feel out this survey to provide feedback on my presentation and the demo section or the presentation.

* Was I too fast?
* Was there too much information?
* Not enough?
* Would you like more/less demo?

> Any errata needs to be corrected. Do not hesitate to call me out in email, during presentation, or in the following survey to make sure all information presented as accurately as possible.
